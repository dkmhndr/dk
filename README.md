##### _Lives in 0s and 1s with â™ª in between._
With over three years of experience as a fullstack engineer, I have built a strong foundation in software development. My journey began at a vocational high school where I majored in Software Engineering, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Communication Science. This combination of technical skills and communication knowledge helps me create projects that connect well with people.
